# Chess-Rating X Meta-Factors

This project is an attempt to predict chess-rating based on meta-factors.
It contains an EDA mediated with visuals and based upon the findings an attempt on a predictive model has been made. I would advise you to clone the project as the github preview has compressed some of the graphs and completely omitted others. Also, i apologize in advance for the sass (not Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), i tried my best to contain it.

# Intro

The purpose of this project is to determine how the meta-factors of chess games change as elo increases, that is, what are the giveaways of a high vs. low rated game. In determining this we'll ascertain the variables of effect and use these inversely to predict elo.

At the time of writing this i'm starting the second year of my bachelors in Cognitive Data Science. This project's inception sprouted from a wish to improve my technical skills beyond what is taught in uni, and doing so with a topic i find interesting. This is one in a long series of projects that will be done during my study but since this is the first, do not expect me to follow established conventions as i am not aware of them... This README was outlined by Chat so i'll blame him for any inconsistencies

# Prerequisites

Install python duh... im on version 3.11.4 FYI
I have utilized the pretty standard DS package so make sure to install the ones below

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn / matplotlib / plotly
- scikit-learn

# Usage

I barely made it work for myself. Don't believe i have the qualification to instruct others how to make it work.

# Future work

As i've mentioned in the notebook there's a lot of room for improvement and the limiting factor is me and my capabilities. Therefore it'll be revisited once im better. We're gonna end it here. I have included most info in the notebook itself and i'll most definitely contradict myself if i start repeating it here so just look in the jupyter notebook please
