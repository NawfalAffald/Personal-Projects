# Chess-Rating X Meta-Factors
This project is an attempt to predict chess-rating based on meta-factors. 
It contains an EDA mediated with visuals and based upon the findings an attempt of a predictive model has been created

# Intro
At the time of writing this i'm starting the second year of my bachelors in Cognitive Data Science. This project's inception sprouted from a wish to improve my technical skills beyond what is taught in uni, and doing so with a topic i find interesting. This is one in a long series of projects that will be done during my study. The purpose of this project is to determine how the meta-factors of chess games change as elo increases, that is, what are the giveaways of a high vs. low rated game. In determining this we'll ascertain the variables of effect and use these inversily to predict elo. 

# Dependencies?
I have utilized the standard DS package of
- Numpy



Contains EDA, Visualizations and Predictive modelling
I've added an unnecessary amount of sass and story-telling but that's just how i prefer to do my projects.
